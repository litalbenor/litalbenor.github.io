      <h2>What is Psychotherapy?</h2>
      <p>
        One-to-one therapy provides a confidential space to explore personal challenges, emotional difficulties, and life transitions. Together, we work to understand patterns, develop coping strategies, and foster personal growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our sessions, you'll have a safe, non-judgmental environment to express yourself freely and work through whatever is troubling you.

      <h2>My Approach</h2>
      <p>
        I work from an integrative therapeutic perspective, informed by a range of established modalities and clinical approaches. My training encompasses systemic approaches (including narrative, family systems, and postmodern perspectives), psychodynamic therapies (such as object relations and attachment-based work), and cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT).
      </p>
      <p>
        My work is grounded in empathy, respect, and thoughtful clinical understanding, allowing space for both emotional depth and practical change. I hold a deep belief in every person's inherent capacity for growth and healing, and I aim to support this process by creating a safe, reflective, and collaborative therapeutic relationship in which meaningful insight and lasting change can emerge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sessions are typically 50 minutes and can be held in-person at my <a href="/en/clinic">North London clinic</a> or online.
