      <h2>What is Individual Therapy?</h2>
      <p>
        One-to-one therapy provides a confidential space to explore personal challenges, emotional difficulties, and life transitions. Together, we work to understand patterns, develop coping strategies, and foster personal growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our sessions, you'll have a safe, non-judgmental environment to express yourself freely and work through whatever is troubling you.
