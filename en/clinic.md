      <h2>A Welcoming Space</h2>
      <p>
        My clinic is located in a quiet, residential area of North London (N12), offering a peaceful environment away from the bustle of central London. The space is designed to feel warm and comfortable, helping you feel at ease from the moment you arrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        The clinic is a warm, inviting space with fresh flowers, hot beverages, comfortable seating, and everything you need to feel safe and relaxed — including fidget toys and private toilet facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Privacy and confidentiality are paramount. The clinic has a private entrance and waiting area, ensuring your visits remain discreet.
