        <h3>Individual Therapy</h3>
        <p>
          One-to-one therapy provides a confidential space to explore personal challenges, emotional difficulties, and life transitions. Together, we work to understand patterns, develop coping strategies, and foster personal growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Common areas I support include anxiety, depression, self-esteem issues, life changes, and personal development.

        <h3>Couples Therapy</h3>
        <p>
          Relationships go through difficult periods, and sometimes couples need support to navigate challenges together. Couples therapy offers a safe space to improve communication, resolve conflicts, and rebuild connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work with couples at all stages — whether you're looking to strengthen your relationship, work through a specific issue, or decide on the future of your partnership.

        <h3>Psychosexual Therapy</h3>
        <p>
          Sexual difficulties can affect individuals and relationships deeply. Psychosexual therapy addresses concerns such as low desire, intimacy issues, sexual anxiety, and relationship dynamics around sexuality.
        </p>
        <p>
          I provide a sensitive, non-judgmental space to explore these topics and work towards a more fulfilling intimate life.

        <h3>EMDR Trauma Therapy</h3>
        <p>
          EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing) is an evidence-based therapy for processing traumatic memories and reducing their emotional impact. It can be effective for PTSD, anxiety, phobias, and other trauma-related difficulties.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a trained EMDR practitioner and integrate this approach when appropriate for clients dealing with past trauma.

        <h3>Online Therapy</h3>
        <p>
          I offer secure online therapy sessions via video call, providing flexibility for clients who prefer remote sessions or cannot attend in person. Online therapy is available for all the services I offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sessions are conducted through a secure, confidential platform to ensure your privacy.
