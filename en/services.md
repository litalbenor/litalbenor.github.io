        <h2>Individual Therapy</h2>
        <p>
          One-to-one therapy provides a confidential space to explore personal challenges, emotional difficulties, and life transitions. Together, we work to understand patterns, develop coping strategies, and foster personal growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Common areas I support include anxiety, depression, self-esteem, life changes, and personal development.

      <article id="couples-therapy" class="service-card">
        <h2>Couples Therapy</h2>
        <p>
          Relationships go through difficult periods, and sometimes couples need support to navigate challenges together. Couples therapy offers a safe space to improve communication, resolve conflicts, and rebuild connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work with couples at all stages — whether you're looking to strengthen your relationship, work through a specific issue, or decide on the future of your partnership.

      <article id="psychosexual-therapy" class="service-card">
        <h2>Psychosexual Therapy</h2>
        <p>
          Sexual difficulties can affect individuals and relationships deeply. Psychosexual therapy addresses concerns such as low desire, intimacy issues, sexual anxiety, and relationship dynamics around sexuality.
        </p>
        <p>
          I provide a sensitive, non-judgmental space to explore these topics and work towards a more fulfilling intimate life.

      <article id="emdr-therapy" class="service-card">
        <h2>EMDR Trauma Therapy</h2>
        <p>
          EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing) is an evidence-based therapy for processing traumatic memories and reducing their emotional impact. It can be effective for PTSD, anxiety, phobias, and other trauma-related difficulties.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a trained EMDR practitioner and integrate this approach when appropriate for clients dealing with past trauma. <a href="/en/articles">Read more about EMDR in my articles →</a>

      <article id="online-therapy" class="service-card">
        <h2>Online Therapy</h2>
        <p>
          I offer secure online therapy sessions via video call, providing flexibility for clients who prefer remote sessions or cannot attend in person. Online therapy is available for all the services I offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sessions are conducted through a secure, confidential platform to ensure your privacy.
