      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a certified couple and individual therapist based in North London (N12), offering therapy in both English and Hebrew. With over 15 years of clinical experience, I provide a warm, non-judgmental space where clients can explore their challenges and find their path forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        My practice supports individuals and couples as they navigate relationship challenges and conflicts, difficulties around intimacy and sexuality, life crises, anxiety, trauma, and emotional distress. I believe that meaningful change emerges within a safe and trusting therapeutic relationship.
