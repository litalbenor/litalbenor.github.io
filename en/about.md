      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a certified couple and individual therapist based in North London (N12), offering therapy in both English and Hebrew. With over 15 years of clinical experience, I provide a warm, non-judgmental space where clients can explore their challenges and find their path forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        My practice focuses on helping individuals and couples navigate relationship difficulties, intimacy issues, trauma, and emotional distress. I believe that meaningful change happens within a safe and trusting therapeutic relationship.

      <h2>Professional Background</h2>
      <p>
        Before relocating to the UK, I worked extensively in Israel's public sector and in legal social work, gaining valuable experience in complex family dynamics and trauma-informed care. This background has shaped my holistic understanding of the challenges individuals and couples face.
      </p>
      <p>
        I continue to develop my professional skills through ongoing training and supervision, ensuring that I offer the highest standard of care to my clients.
