      <h2>What is EMDR?</h2>
      <p>
        EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing) is an evidence-based therapy for processing traumatic memories and reducing their emotional impact. It helps the brain process distressing experiences so they no longer cause the same level of disturbance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a trained EMDR practitioner and integrate this approach when appropriate for clients dealing with past trauma.

      <h2>How EMDR Works</h2>
      <p>
        During EMDR, you'll recall distressing experiences while engaging in bilateral stimulation (such as guided eye movements). This helps your brain reprocess the memory, reducing its emotional charge.
      </p>
      <p>
        EMDR is well-researched and recommended by the NHS and WHO for treating trauma. Sessions can be held in-person at my <a href="/en/clinic">North London clinic</a> or online.
