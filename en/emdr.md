      <h2>What is EMDR?</h2>
      <p>
        EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing) is a powerful, evidence-based psychotherapy that helps people heal from trauma and other distressing life experiences. Developed in the late 1980s, EMDR has since become one of the most researched and effective treatments for trauma, anxiety, and a wide range of emotional difficulties.
      </p>
      <p>
        EMDR works by stimulating both sides of the brain through bilateral stimulation — such as guided eye movements, sounds, or tactile sensations. This process helps the brain reprocess traumatic memories, reducing their emotional intensity and allowing clients to move forward without being held back by the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        EMDR is well-researched and recommended by the NHS and WHO for treating trauma. Sessions can be held in-person at my <a href="/en/clinic">clinic</a> or online.

      <h2>How I Use EMDR in My Practice</h2>
      <p>
        In my practice, I use EMDR both as a standalone therapy and as a complementary modality integrated within broader therapeutic work. Some clients come specifically for EMDR treatment, while others benefit from incorporating it into their ongoing therapy when we encounter deep-rooted issues that need targeted processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        EMDR is a relatively new yet remarkably powerful tool that enables me to help clients reach the root causes of their difficulties and untangle long-held emotional patterns. It can be transformative for issues that have felt "stuck" despite previous therapeutic work.
