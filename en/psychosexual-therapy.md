      <h2>What is Psychosexual Therapy?</h2>
      <p>
        Sexual difficulties can affect individuals and relationships deeply. Psychosexual therapy addresses the emotional, psychological, and relational aspects of sexuality and intimacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I provide a sensitive, non-judgmental space to explore these topics and work towards a more fulfilling intimate life.

      <h2>How Psychosexual Therapy Works</h2>
      <p>
        Psychosexual therapy is a talking therapy that explores the emotional and psychological factors affecting your sexual wellbeing. Sessions may involve individuals or couples, depending on your needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        All conversations are completely confidential. Sessions can be held in-person at my <a href="/en/clinic">North London clinic</a> or online.
