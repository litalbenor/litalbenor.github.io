      <h2>What is Couples Therapy?</h2>
      <p>
        Relationships go through difficult periods, and sometimes couples need support to navigate challenges together. Couples therapy offers a safe space to improve communication, resolve conflicts, and rebuild connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work with couples at all stages — whether you're looking to strengthen your relationship, work through a specific issue, or decide on the future of your partnership.

      <h2>How Couples Therapy Works</h2>
      <p>
        In couples therapy, both partners attend sessions together. I create a balanced, neutral space where each person can express themselves and feel heard.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work together to identify patterns, improve understanding, and develop new ways of relating to each other. Sessions are typically 50-80 minutes and can be held in-person at my <a href="/en/clinic">North London clinic</a> or online.
